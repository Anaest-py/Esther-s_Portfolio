![](https://github.com/Anaest-py/My-Portfolio/blob/main/images/IMG_20210728_161828_933.jpg)


I am Esther Chinenye Anagu, an aspiring data analyst. Although I did not have a background in Data Science but of course, because of my determination and passion for it, through learning and studying, I have been able to improve in my data analysis skills. I have enrolled in courses on various platforms, such as Udereka, Udemy, IBM, Coursera, etc. I have also watched various YouTube videos that have helped in this journey. Moreso, I was given a scholarship on AWS Machine Learning by Udacity, thus increasing my knowledge base.

I love continuous improvement, thus making it easy for me to learn new things and adapting to changes easily. As a result, an organization with a culture of continuous improvement and positive environment interests me the most. This would make them succeed amongst all odds. My main objective is to add value to your organization and ensure that I work towards making your visions and missions accomplished through the use of data. However, I am willing to learn and know more and have more expertise in this field.

## Education
* Masters of Business Admistration (Advanced AI and Automation), *Nexford University*, 2020-2021
* Bachelors of Science (Accounting), *University of Benin, Benin-city*, 2015-2019

## [Project 1: Data Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/anagu.esther)
As an organization, it will be difficult to make sense out of the data unless it is visualized. One of our duties, as data scientists, is to tell stories with data via data visualization. I can use the following tools: Power BI, Tableau, and Excel to visualize data.

Also, I wrote an [article](https://anaguesther2.medium.com/in-todays-world-data-has-increased-in-volume-velocity-variety-veracity-and-value-and-these-736d0cc70808) on data visualization and in the article, I gave a report on three (3) important aspects of the Global Superstore datasets from the sample datasets provided by Tableau — Product analysis, Customer analysis, and the sales trends throughout 4years.
The objectives of the Article were:

To ascertain and report on the rate of change in sales over four (4) years, 2014–2018.
To analyze the products and identify the unprofitable products and give appropriate recommendations.
To analyze the company’s customers, identify the loyal ones, and how we can provide continued satisfaction





## [Project 2: Data Analysis using Pandas](https://github.com/Anaest-py/Week-5-Assessment/blob/master/Anagu%20Esther%20WT-21-074/Project2%20on%20Economic%20Indicators'%20Correlation%20(GDP%20and%20Unemployment%20Rate).ipynb)

![](https://github.com/Anaest-py/My-Portfolio/blob/main/images/Screenshot_20210803-143756.png)

In this project, I used the datasets for 2019 from the worldbank website to find the correlation between the GDP rate and Unemployment rate. To accomplish this, I followed the following steps:
* Gathered the datasets from the World Bank website.
* Cleaned and transformed the datasets.
* Calculated the correlation between the GDP growth rate and Unemployment rate.
* Visualized the outcome to get a better view.

## [Project 3: Microsoft Excel and VBA](https://1drv.ms/x/s!AvSxhnHB1dH7hgYWkWlXp_Ymov7M)
![](https://github.com/Anaest-py/My-Portfolio/blob/main/images/images%20(36).jpeg)

In this project, I used Microsoft Excel to:
* Create a macro to format texts of which the final texts are
centralized, made bold, and the font: Verdana and Font size: 11.

* Add a button to the worksheet, using the Developer ribbon (Form controls), 
and assign it to a macro that changes the background color of selected cells 
to green.
* Create an Inputbox that converts a measurement from inches to centimeters. 
* Create an Inputbox within a Do Loop to access value additions, 
* Make a Msgbox with vbYesNo argument.
* Create an algorithm to access a student's final score. 
* Design a userform.

## [Project 4: Tkinter Voice Assistant (An NLP System)](https://github.com/Anaest-py/Tkinter_search_engine)
![](https://github.com/Anaest-py/My-Portfolio/blob/main/images/Project4.png)

In the course of my four months training at Women Techsters Fellowship program, my team of 9 and I built an NLP system, a voice-recognition search engine that helps people, through their voice, search for words, as the name implies, irrespective of their diverse accent. Even though, I was not the team leader, there was a high level of collaboration and teamwork in the project. My role was making sure that everything was going as planned and I also gave important presentation tips to the presenter which made us perform excellently well.

* **Environment:** Jupyter notebook.
* **Python libraries used:** Tkinter, Speech Recognition, Google text to speech, etc.
* **Websites:** geeksforgeeks, Kaggle, CodeAcademy, DataCamp, & Analytics Vidhya.
* **Platforms:** YouTube Tutorials.
